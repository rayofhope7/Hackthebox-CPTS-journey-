>>>>>>   Penetration Testing Phase I: Pre-Engagement Phase
At this stage, the security expert analyzes the test's logistics and rules of engagement. 
The VAPT providers and the target organization discuss the exercise's legal implications and contractual agreements are made. 

>>>>>>   The entire pre-engagement process consists of three essential components:
1) Scoping questionnaire: 
2) Pre-engagement meeting:
3) Kick-off meeting: 

NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement): - 
> Unilateral NDA	This type of NDA obligates only one party to maintain confidentiality and allows the other party to share the information received with third parties.
> Bilateral NDA	In this type, both parties are obligated to keep the resulting and acquired information confidential. 
> Multilateral NDA	Multilateral NDA is a commitment to confidentiality by more than two parties. If we conduct a penetration test for a cooperative network, 
all parties responsible and involved must sign this document.

What time and what documents do we need to create?

1. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): -                                After Initial Contact
2. Scoping Questionnaire: -                                         Before the Pre-Engagement Meeting
3. Scoping Document: - 	                                            During the Pre-Engagement Meeting
4. Penetration Testing Proposal (Contract/Scope of Work (SoW)): - 	During the Pre-engagement Meeting
5. Rules of Engagement (RoE): - 	                                  Before the Kick-Off Meeting
6. Contractors Agreement (Physical Assessments): - 	                Before the Kick-Off Meeting
7. Reports: -                                                     	During and after the conducted Penetration Test
